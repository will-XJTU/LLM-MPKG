# LLM-MPKG
Three datasets for machining process knowledge graph construction
# datasets
These three datasets are used to support the construction of a machining process knowledge graph for large language models. They are the manually annotated dataset, the raw dataset for LLM pre-annotated, and the case dataset for knowledge graph construction respectively. This is the first publicly available corpus for this domain-specific field.
